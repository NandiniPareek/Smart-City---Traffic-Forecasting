# Smart-City---Traffic-Forecasting
This project was done under the Industrial Intership provided by UpSkill Campus and The IoT Academy in collaboration with Industrial Partner UniConverge Technologies Pvt Ltd (UCT). This internship was focused on a project/problem statement provided by UCT. The project including the report was to be finished in 6 weeks' time. 

About the PROJECT
Nowadays, cities must address the challenge of sustainable mobility. Traffic state forecasting plays a key role in mitigating traffic congestion in urban areas. For example, predicting path travel time is a crucial issue in navigation and route planning applications. 
The proposed solution uses Machine Learning Algorithms. Machine learning (ML) allows us to create predictive models that consider large masses of heterogeneous data from different sources. Various ML algorithms were used and compared to find out the algorithm that gives the best accuracy range.
